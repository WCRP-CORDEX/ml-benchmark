      description: >
        Short acronym that uniquely identifies your institution
      placeholder: "IFCA"
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: input
    id: institution

  # Emulator Information
  - type: markdown
    attributes:
      value: "## Emulation Method Details"

  - type: input
    id: emulator_id
    attributes:
      label: Emulator identifier (`emulator_id`)
      description: >
        Identifier of the emulator model including the emulator name (e.g., DeepESD, XGBoost, ...) and the particular version, using the format \{emulator name\}-\{version\}. Note that any change or different versions need to be registered separately with the corresponding metadata. For versions of the model using orography as predictor, use the tag `-orog` at the end of the identifier (e.g. `DeepESD-asym1-orog`).
      placeholder: "DeepESD-asym1"
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: emulator
    attributes:
      label: Emulator Description
      description: >
        Detailed description of the emulation method including architecture and key 
        features, such as loss function, optimizer and hyperparameters, predictors used and 
        standardization, etc. Enough detail to distinguish the emulator and version from 
        any other version should be provided.
      placeholder: "Deep convolutional neural network including 3 convolution and one dense layer, with ReLU activation functions. Standardized input data at gridbox level using mean/std of reanalysis in training period. No bias adjustment performed. Training on historical and future experiments."
